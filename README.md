# Implicit-Arm-M4L

A MaxForLive audio effect device which can be dropped anywhere in the Ableton session to give 'IMPLICIT ARM' support (native to Push)

With Push, Ableton added a nifty feature called impicit arm (light red arming of track) which would automatically arm the selected track when you would switch using the Push. This M4L device allows you to do it without the push.Turn the toggle on, and any track you jump to will auto arm
